               <h5 Class = "lady_hunstanton name_Hover"> LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p Class = "stageDirections hover"> [_Sitting down_.]</p>  <p>We came to inquire for your dear
               mother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?</p>
               
               <h5 Class = "gerald name_Hover"> GERALD.</h5> <p>My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.</p>
               
               <h5 Class = "lady_hunstanton name_Hover"> LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last
               night.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it
               was the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets
               on one’s nerves.</p>
               
               <h5 Class = "mrs_allonby name_Hover"> MRS.ALLONBY</h5>.  <p>It’s the same thing, nowadays.</p>
               
               <h5 Class = "lady_hunstanton name_Hover"> LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am
               afraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.
               Arbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?</p>
               
               <h5 Class = "mrs_allonby name_Hover"> MRS.ALLONBY.</h5>  <p Class = "stageDirections hover"> [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]</p>  <p>It looks
               quite the happy English home.</p>
               
               <h5 Class= "lady_hunstanton name_Hover"> LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.
               One feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,
               Gerald.</p>
